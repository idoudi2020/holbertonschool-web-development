# CSS Advanced School Project

## Overview

"CSS, Advanced" is the continuation of the "HTML, Advanced" project, focusing on bringing style and design to the previously structured HTML document. This project revolves around applying CSS to a web page based on a designer's mockup, emphasizing the use of modern CSS practices to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.

## Design File

The project continues to use the design mockup from Figma, which was the basis for the HTML structure. The design can be viewed here: [Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage)

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To apply CSS to the HTML structure created in the "HTML, Advanced" project.
- To focus on layout, color schemes, typography, and responsive design.
- To use modern CSS practices and techniques to achieve a design that closely matches the mockup.

## Structure

The CSS styling will be applied to all sections of the webpage, including:

- **Header**: Styling the navigation and logo.
- **Banner**: Designing an engaging introductory section.
- **Quote**: Stylizing the quote section for emphasis.
- **Videos**: Layout and styling for the video listings.
- **Membership**: Designing the presentation of membership options.
- **FAQ**: Formatting the FAQ section for readability.
- **Footer**: Finalizing the webpage with a styled footer.
